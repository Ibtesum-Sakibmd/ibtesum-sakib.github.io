                        <p>I enjoyed this course a lot.<br> I learned so -<br>
                          Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and
                          Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
                          Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or
                          surpassing human-level performance
                          Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning<br>coursera.org/verify/TGDSQS2YZDXF</p>
